# Edit Emails Before Send

This module is in first steps of development and needs lots of things to do. But at first it can add address of delivery and invoice into the shipped.html template. 

This addition does not have any overrides and this is totally safe to install. Whenever you think that you do not need the email template edit just disable or delete the module and every thing goes back to normal.
